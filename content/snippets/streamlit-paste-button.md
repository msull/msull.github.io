I was looking for a way to paste images directly into a Streamlit app and came across the "Streamlit Paste Button"
component:

* [Github](https://github.com/olucaslopes/streamlit-paste-button/)
* [Demo Page](https://paste-button.streamlit.app/)

This component proved easy to work with, and I was able to incorporate it into my app exactly as hoped.
