❯ eg --model anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0 'examine the python files in this directory and then write a small markdown file named "notes.md" that briefly covers the purpose of each module, along with an overall summary. slackbot.py is the main file to start with.' --use-cwd  -f --max-cost .25
Task: examine the python files in this directory and then write a small markdown file named "notes.md" that briefly covers the purpose of each module, along
with an overall summary. slackbot.py is the main file to start with.
Generating a plan to accomplish this task...
I'll outline a plan to analyze the Python files and create documentation:

 1 First, use ListFiles to get all Python files in directory
    • Set recursive=true to catch any in subdirectories
 2 Start with slackbot.py:
    • Use ReadFile to examine its contents
    • Note its main purpose and key functionality
 3 Examine each additional Python file found:
    • Use ReadFile for each one
    • Note their purposes and relationships to slackbot.py
    • Keep track of key points for each module
 4 Create notes.md:
    • Use WriteFile to create a new markdown file
    • Structure will include:
       • Brief overview section
       • Section for each module with purpose/role
       • Dependencies between modules if relevant

Would you like me to proceed with this plan?

I have completed the task of examining the Python files and creating a documentation overview. The notes.md file has been created with a comprehensive summary
of the project structure, including:

 1 A high-level overview of the Slackbot project
 2 Detailed descriptions of each core module:
    • slackbot.py (main entry point and event handling)
    • agent.py (AI agent functionality)
    • api_helper.py (dataroomHQ API integration)
    • tools.py (custom AI agent tools)
    • utils.py (utility functions)
 3 Key features of the system
 4 Integration points with external services

The documentation provides a clear picture of how the different components work together to create a Slack bot that interfaces with dataroomHQ's platform,
handles user interactions, and provides data analysis capabilities.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the documentation or provide additional details about specific components?
