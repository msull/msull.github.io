> A surrealist painting by RenÃ© Magritte titled 'The Principle of Pleasure' showing a figure in a dark business suit and
> tie seated at a wooden desk. Instead of a head, there is a glowing orb of bright light against a dark background. The
> figure's hands rest on the desk surface, where a small rock or stone is placed. The painting style is realistic except
> for the supernatural element of the luminous head.
